This repository is the companion code to the papers *Primordial Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds from a Sharp Feature in Three-field Inflation* ([I](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00065) and II), by Vikas Aragam, Sonia Paban, and Robert Rosati.


# Quick start

## Mathematica

The Bogoliubov coefficients for two and three fields are stored in the `*.wl` files. The files with `*Small*` in the name correspond to the branch of solutions with $` {\cal M}_{ss,0}, {\cal M}_{bb,0} \leq 9/4 `$ (cf. Eq (2.11) of paper II), while the other files are the branch with larger constant masses. Each file contains two variables

  - `regIIIcoeffsSimp`: these are the Bogoliubov coefficients of the sharp feature's excited state
  - `Î±sols`: the WKB exponents during the feature are $` \pm \sqrt{\alpha_i} `$. 

Example usage and plots reproducing many of the figures of our work are available in `bog_plotting_clean.nb`.
